- Add option for using text file as input
- Improve output in the following ways:
    * Add icon for linking to source (if available)
    * Show authors (if available)
    * Find a good way to show tips (if available)
    * Make failures not look horrendous
    * show byte/char/score counter
- Add packers (any others are welcome too):
    * JS 4:1 packer by Frank Force
    * regpack
    * bitcrusher
    * Python 2:1
    * Python 3:1

BUGS:
- HTML has a hard time printing some strings. Example: the JavaScript, number: fewest bytes ASCII packer breaks on the number 7745.
  The encoded string there should be "<A", this HTML interprets as opening a new tag. Not sure how to fix it.
