# Omni-packer
This is a program that applies any available packer to your code/string/number to make it as short as possible.
The goal of this project is as much to simplify and automate packing, as it is to be a library of all known packing strategies.
It is also intended to provide additional information about these strategies, such as its original author, a link to an original article or implementation, its limitations, and any tips for how to further make use of the packer.

These packers are meant to be used in the context of https://code.golf/. Some may not work in other contexts. 

PRs to add new packers in any language, add information for packers, or improve their performance are very welcome.
